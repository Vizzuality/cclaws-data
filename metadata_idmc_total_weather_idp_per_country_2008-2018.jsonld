      "description":"This dataset tracks the number of people who have been internally displaced due to natural disasters worldwide each year. “Internal displacement” refers to the forced movement of people within the country that they live in. Millions of people are forced to flee their homes each year due to conflict, violence, development projects, disasters, and climate change and remain displaced within their countries of residence. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) can include both citizens and other habitual residents of the country, such as stateless persons. IDPs from weather hazards may have been displaced by the following types of events; Meteorological - storms, extreme temperatures, severe winter condition, Hydrological - flooding, wet mass movement, wave action, and Climatological - wildfires, drought. Some of the typical needs and protection risks that arise in internal displacement include family separation, loss of documentation, loss of property, and further exposure to the risk of continued displacement.This dataset is produced by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) with the aim of informing policy and operational decisions in order to reduce the risk of future displacement and improve the lives of IDPs worldwide. Cumalitive sums of IDPs were calculated by aggregating all recorded events by country between 208 and 2018. Note data may not be available for all countries during the whole time period.",
